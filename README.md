### ConfLM: Using LLMs and YANG Embeddings for Network Device Configuration
A technology demonstrator system that uses text embeddings to semantically understand YANG data models and automatically generate appropriate router configurations. The tool creates vector representations of both YANG models and configuration templates, finds the most semantically similar matches, and renders configurations with user-supplied parameters. It also supports cross-vendor translation, generating equivalent configurations for different network equipment vendors (like Cisco and Juniper) from the same network intent.It has a simple chat interface to interact with a locally run llm (using ollama), to provide interactive response to generate configuration snippets.  Has not been tested extensively, so use at your own risk :-)
